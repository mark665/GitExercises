 Isilon Git Workshop PrerequisitesSetup Git 	Git is installed (https://wiki.west.isilon.com/index.php/Git)	      Add SSH Key (https://wiki.west.isilon.com/index.php/Git)Workshop Setup      Setup global user name and email        git config –global user name “[your name]”       git config –global user email “[your email address]”      Note: This is a per machine setting, not per repositoryLab ExercisesBlob Exercise1. Create a new local repositorya. git init [name of repository]2. Create a blob objectecho “Hello” | git hash-object –w --stdinNote:* git hash-object= Compute object ID and optionally creates a blob from a file* –w= Writes the object into the object database (.git/objects)3. Verify that the object is in the object folderls .git/objects/[first 2 digits from the hash]/[remaining hash digits]4. Verify that the object type is a blobgit cat-file –t [first 8 digits of hash]5. Verify that the object value is “Hello”git cat-file –p [first 8 digits of hash]Tree Exercise1. Update/add the filegit update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \[object hash] [file]2. Create a treegit write-tree3. Verify the object type is a treegit cat-file –t [first 8 of tree hash]4. Verify the object type, parent, author and committergit cat-file –t [first 8 of tree hash]Commit Tree Exercise1. Create a second objectEcho “World” | git hash-object –w --stdin 2. Update the object indexgit update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \[object hash] [file name]3. Create a tree git write-tree4. Commit the first tree git commit-tree [first 8 digits of first tree hash] –m “[commit message]”5. Commit the second treegit commit-tree [first 8 digits of first tree hash] –m “[commit message]”6. Verify object type, parent, author, committer of second tree commitgit cat-file -p [first 8 digits second tree commit hash]7. Move branch pointer to tree objectecho “[second tree hash]” >.git/refs/heads/master8. Move the blob objects to filesecho “Hello”>file.txtecho “Hello”>file2.txtTag Exercise1. Create a tag git tag -a -m “Annotate tag example” tag-1 master2. Show tag referencegit show-ref tag-13. Show branch referencegit show-ref master4. Verify object type, tag reference, taggergit cat-file -p [first 8 digits of tag-1 hash]
Files Exercise1. Create 5 files with 2 files in subdirectory2. Stage a filegit add [file name]3. Commit the filegit commit [file name] -m “[commit message]”4. Check the file statusgit status5. Stage a second filegit add [file name]6. Edit the newly staged file7. Stage the filegit add [file name]8. Commit the filegit commit [file name] -m “[commit message]”9. Stage a third filegit add [file name]10. Move/Rename a filegit mv [source file] [sub directory/destination file]11. Stage the moved/renamed filegit add [moved/renamed file]12. Check the file statusgit status13. Commit the filegit commit [file name] -m “[commit message]”Branches1. Create a new branch git branch[new branch name]2. Checkout the branchgit checkout [branch name]3. Edit file4. Stage filegit add [filename]5. Commit the filegit commit [file name]6. Checkout branch you wish to merge TOgit checkout [destination branch]7. Merge the branch to the master branchgit merge [target branch name] Note: At this point you should have 2 branches- Master and your newly created branch. This exercise is a local branch merge so the branch name being merged to should be Master.8. Back out of this repositorycd ..9. Run branch conflict script./git-create-conflict.sh10. Change directory into i-merge-conflict repository11. Merge fix branchgit merge fix12. Resolve merge conflictManually edit, add, commit13. Merge topic branchgit merge topic14. Resolve merge conflictManually edit, add, commit15. Look at merge history with log commandgit log –-oneline --graph16. Verify the changes to the filecat [merged file that was in conflict]17. Back out of repository and delete        rm –rf i-merge-conflict)Remote Work	1. Re-use repository we’ve been working in for previous exercises2. Create a branch with your desktop id (i.e. mprice)git branch [desktop]	git checkout [desktop]3. Set up remote repositoryGit remote add training git@github.west.isilon.com:IsiEngTraining/GitTraining.git4. Fetchgit fetch training5. Merge remote master branch into [desktop id] branchgit merge training master
6. Push into githubgit push –set-upstream training [desktop id]7. Pull RequestGo into github and create a pull request for your branch into master8. Instructor will merge one pull request, then show others in conflict, unable to mergeManipulating History1. Run git-prep-interactive-rebase.sh2. Rebase interactive BR_TWO to combine commits into one commit.cd i-rebasegit checkout BR_TWOgit log –-onelinegit rebase –i foo       edit to squash commits3. Change the commit message for the commit you just createdgit log --onelinegit rebase foo	use ‘r’ to change commit message in editor4. Rebase BR_ONE against mastergit checkout BR_ONEgit rebase master5. Merge BR_ONE into mastergit checkout mastergit merge BR_ONE6. Rebase BR_TWO against mastergit checkout BR_TWOgit rebase masterResolve conflictgit rebase --continue7. merge BR_TWO into mastergit checkout mastergit merge BR_TWO
Isilon Workflow1. Navigate to git@github.west.isilon.com:IsiEngTraining/GitTraining.git2.	Fork a new personal repository from the team repositorya. Click on the  icon in the upper right corner b. Chose your account as the destination of the forkc. Navigate to your account/OneFS repod. Select branch “training”i. Create a branch in your account with your usernamea. In the lower right URL field select SSH as the type of clone URL b. Click on the  icon to copy the URl to the clipboard3.	Cloninga. Open a command shellb. Navigate to the directory you want the repository to be cloned toc. Type: git clone [paste SSH URL][git@github.west.isilon.com:[your-git-username]/[team-branch].git]		Wait (OneFS can take time to clone)5. UpdatesEdit a .c file, add, commit, rebase against “training_next” and push the results to github (origin branch [desktop id])6. Review BoardFrom command prompt, use rbt to post to Review Board7.
